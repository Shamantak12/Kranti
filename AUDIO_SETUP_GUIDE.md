# üéµ Audio Files Setup Guide - Complete Tutorial

## Step 1: Understanding Audio in React Native/Expo

React Native apps handle audio files differently than web apps. Here's what you need to know:

### **File Structure Created:**
```
assets/audio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ambient/                    # ‚úÖ Created - Background music
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ morning-raga.mp3       # To be added
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ forest-sounds.mp3      # To be added  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ temple-bells.mp3       # To be added
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ river-meditation.mp3   # To be added
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meditation/                # ‚úÖ Created - Main content
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guided/                # ‚úÖ Created - Guided sessions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ breathing/             # ‚úÖ Created - Breathing exercises
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mantras/                   # ‚úÖ Created - Sanskrit chants
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ quick-sessions/            # ‚úÖ Created - Short practices
```

## Step 6: Quick Test Files (Placeholders)

If you want to test immediately, you can use these short samples:

### **Create Simple Test Audio:**
```javascript
// You can record simple "Om" chanting using your phone
// Or use text-to-speech for testing:
// "Om Namah Shivaya" - 3 minutes
// Save as: quick-sessions/3min-om.mp3
```

## Step 7: Enabling Audio in Your App

Once you have audio files, follow these steps:

### **1. Update BackgroundMusicService.ts:**
```typescript
// Change this line:
private isEnabled: boolean = false; // Change to true
```

### **2. Verify File Paths:**
```typescript
// Make sure these match your actual files:
private audioTracks = {
  morning: require('../../assets/audio/ambient/morning-raga.mp3'),
  afternoon: require('../../assets/audio/ambient/forest-sounds.mp3'),
  evening: require('../../assets/audio/ambient/temple-bells.mp3'),
  night: require('../../assets/audio/ambient/river-meditation.mp3'),
};
```

## Step 8: Testing Audio

### **1. Test on Device:**
```bash
# Run on your phone
npx expo start
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

### **2. Check Console:**
```javascript
// Look for these messages:
"Playing morning background music"
"Audio initialization successful"
```

### **3. Test Music Controls:**
- Tap the music icon in the home screen
- Should pause/resume background music
- Check volume levels

## Step 9: Optimizing Audio Files

### **Using Audacity (Free Audio Editor):**

1. **Download Audacity** (free)
2. **Open your audio file**
3. **Apply these effects:**
   ```
   Effect > Amplify > Set to -18dB
   Effect > Normalize > Check "Remove DC offset"
   Effect > Compressor > Use preset "Soft Limiter"
   ```
4. **Export as MP3:**
   ```
   File > Export > Export as MP3
   Quality: 128kbps
   Channel Mode: Stereo
   ```

## Step 10: Content Creation Tips

### **For Indian Spiritual Content:**

1. **Morning Raga (5 AM - 12 PM):**
   - Use energizing ragas like Bhairav, Yaman
   - Include sitar, tabla, flute
   - Gradually increasing tempo

2. **Forest Sounds (12 PM - 5 PM):**

   - Include: birds, insects, wind in trees
   - Mix with subtle Indian instruments

3. **Temple Bells (5 PM - 9 PM):**
   - Authentic temple recordings
   - Mix with evening birds
   - Add distant chanting (low volume)

4. **River Meditation (9 PM - 5 AM):**
